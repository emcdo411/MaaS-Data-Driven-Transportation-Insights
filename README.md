# AI-Driven MaaS Company Business Plan

This project aims to simulate and analyze data for a Mobility as a Service (MaaS) company, focusing on AI-driven transportation solutions in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) metroplex. The simulated datasets include information about vehicle fleet, charging stations, AI systems, R&D projects, workforce, and capital investment. We will perform advanced visualizations and analysis to determine optimal areas for MaaS locations and visualize key business metrics.

## Datasets

### 1. **Inventory Data (Vehicle Fleet & Charging Stations)**
The inventory dataset simulates the vehicle fleet and charging stations for the MaaS company.

```r
# Simulate Inventory Data (Vehicle Fleet & Charging Stations)
set.seed(123)

n_vehicles <- 200  # Number of vehicles
n_stations <- 10   # Number of charging stations

# Vehicle fleet dataset
vehicle_data <- data.frame(
  Vehicle_ID = paste0("V", sprintf("%03d", 1:n_vehicles)),
  Vehicle_Type = sample(c("Car", "Bike", "Scooter"), n_vehicles, replace = TRUE),
  Status = sample(c("Active", "Inactive", "Maintenance"), n_vehicles, replace = TRUE),
  Battery_Level = round(runif(n_vehicles, 20, 100), 0),  # Battery level percentage
  Charging_Station_ID = sample(1:n_stations, n_vehicles, replace = TRUE),
  Location = paste0("Lat:", round(runif(n_vehicles, 32.5, 33.0), 6), " Lng:", round(runif(n_vehicles, -97.0, -96.5), 6))
)

# Print a sample of the data
head(vehicle_data)
```

### 2. **Technology Data (AI Systems)**
This dataset represents the AI models used for route optimization, demand forecasting, and other aspects of the MaaS system.

```r
# Simulate Technology Data (AI Systems)
set.seed(124)

n_models <- 5  # Number of AI models

# AI system dataset
ai_data <- data.frame(
  AI_Model = c("Route Optimizer", "Demand Forecaster", "Driver Behavior Analyzer", "Maintenance Predictor", "Pricing Algorithm"),
  Accuracy = round(runif(n_models, 85, 98), 1),  # AI model accuracy in percentage
  Processing_Power = sample(c("Low", "Medium", "High"), n_models, replace = TRUE),
  Cost = round(runif(n_models, 50000, 200000), -3),  # Cost of implementation in USD
  Maintenance = round(runif(n_models, 5000, 20000), -2)  # Maintenance cost in USD
)

# Print the data
ai_data
```

### 3. **Innovation Data (Research & Development)**
This dataset simulates R&D projects, their expected investment, and the number of patents filed.

```r
# Simulate Innovation Data (Research & Development)
set.seed(125)

n_projects <- 4  # Number of R&D projects

# R&D project dataset
innovation_data <- data.frame(
  Project_ID = paste0("P", sprintf("%03d", 1:n_projects)),
  Project_Type = sample(c("Autonomous Vehicle", "New Payment System", "Smart Charging", "AI-Driven Traffic Management"), n_projects, replace = TRUE),
  Investment = round(runif(n_projects, 2000000, 10000000), -3),  # Investment in USD
  Completion_Year = sample(2025:2030, n_projects, replace = TRUE),
  Patents = sample(1:5, n_projects, replace = TRUE)  # Number of patents filed
)

# Print the data
innovation_data
```

### 4. **Workforce Data (Employees)**
The workforce dataset simulates employee roles, salaries, and employment status.

```r
# Simulate Workforce Data (Employees)
set.seed(126)

n_employees <- 100  # Number of employees

# Workforce dataset
workforce_data <- data.frame(
  Employee_ID = paste0("E", sprintf("%04d", 1:n_employees)),
  Role = sample(c("AI Expert", "Driver", "Operations Manager", "Data Scientist", "Software Engineer"), n_employees, replace = TRUE),
  Salary = round(runif(n_employees, 50000, 150000), -3),  # Salary in USD
  Location = sample(c("DFW", "San Francisco", "New York", "Austin"), n_employees, replace = TRUE),
  Employment_Status = sample(c("Full-time", "Part-time"), n_employees, replace = TRUE)
)

# Print the data
head(workforce_data)
```

### 5. **Capital Data (Investment & Financial Data)**
This dataset simulates capital investments from venture capital firms, their equity, and expected ROI.

```r
# Simulate Capital Data (Investment & Financial Data)
set.seed(127)

n_investors <- 5  # Number of investors

# Capital dataset
capital_data <- data.frame(
  Investor = c("Venture Capital Firm A", "Venture Capital Firm B", "Venture Capital Firm C", "Venture Capital Firm D", "Venture Capital Firm E"),
  Investment_Amount = round(runif(n_investors, 5000000, 20000000), -3),  # Investment in USD
  Investment_Date = sample(seq(as.Date("2020-01-01"), as.Date("2024-01-01"), by = "days"), n_investors, replace = TRUE),
  Equity = round(runif(n_investors, 5, 25), 1),  # Percentage of equity given
  ROI = round(runif(n_investors, 10, 30), 1)  # Return on investment in percentage
)

# Print the data
